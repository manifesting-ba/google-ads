# Project Background
Analytica Institute is a sample EdTech company that provides specialized data analytics courses and certifications. Digital marketing—particularly through Google Ads—plays a central role in the company’s customer acquisition strategy, driving awareness, conversions, and long-term enrollments. 

This project focuses on analyzing one major Google Ads campaign promoting the company’s courses. By cleaning, consolidating, and synthesizing this data, the analysis aims to uncover actionable insights that will improve campaign efficiency and overall business performance.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Ad Performance Analysis: Evaluation of ROAS, CTR, and CVR to determine campaign efficiency.
- Time-Based Performance: Identifying weekday and monthly patterns through CTR, CVR, and ROAS to uncover seasonality and guide budget allocation.
- Audience & Device Trends: Understanding how different devices and keywords contribute to campaign outcomes (ROAS, CTR, CVR).
